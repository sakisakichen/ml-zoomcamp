## 1.1 Introduction to Machine Learning
The concept of ML is depicted with an example of predicting the price of a car.   
The ML model learns from data, represented as some **features** such as year, mileage, among others, and the **target** variable, in this
case, the car's price, by extracting patterns from the data.

Then, the model is given new data (**without** the target) about cars and predicts their price (target). 

In summary, ML is a process of **extracting patterns from data**, which is of two types:

* features (information about the object) and 
* target (property to predict for unseen objects). 

Therefore, new feature values are presented to the model, and it makes **predictions** from the learned patterns.


## 1.2 ML vs Rule-Based Systems
The differences between ML and Rule-Based systems is explained with the example of a **spam filter**.

Traditional Rule-Based systems are based on a set of **characteristics** (keywords, email length, etc.) that identify an email as spam or not. As spam emails keep changing over time the system needs to be upgraded making the process untractable due to the complexity of code maintenance as the system grows.

ML can be used to solve this problem with the following steps:

### 1. Get data 
Emails from the user's spam folder and inbox gives examples of spam and non-spam.

### 2. Define and calculate features
Rules/characteristics from rule-based systems can be used as a starting point to define features for the ML model. The value of the target variable for each email can be defined based on where the email was obtained from (spam folder or inbox).

Each email can be encoded (converted) to the values of it's features and target.

### 3. Train and use the model
A machine learning algorithm can then be applied to the encoded emails to build a model that can predict whether a new email is spam or not spam. The **predictions are probabilities**, and to make a decision it is necessary to define a threshold to classify emails as spam or not spam. 


## 1.3 Supervised Machine Learning
In Supervised Machine Learning (SML) there are always labels associated with certain features.
The model is trained, and then it can make predictions on new features. In this way, the model
is taught by certain features and targets. 

* **Feature matrix (X):** made of observations or objects (rows) and features (columns).
* **Target variable (y):** a vector with the target information we want to predict. For each row of X there's a value in y.


The model can be represented as a function **g** that takes the X matrix as a parameter and tries
to predict values as close as possible to y targets. 
The obtention of the g function is what it is called **training**.

### Types of SML problems 

* **Regression:** the output is a number (car's price)
* **Classification:** the output is a category (spam example). 
	* **Binary:** there are two categories. 
	* **Multiclass problems:** there are more than two categories. 
* **Ranking:** the output is the big scores associated with certain items. It is applied in recommender systems. 

In summary, SML is about teaching the model by showing different examples, and the goal is
to come up with a function that takes the feature matrix as a
parameter and makes predictions as close as possible to the y targets.

CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an open standard process model that describes common approaches used by data mining experts. It is the most widely-used analytics model. Was conceived in 1996 and became a European Union project under the ESPRIT funding initiative in 1997. The project was led by five companies: Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL), Teradata, Daimler AG, NCR Corporation and OHRA, an insurance company: 

1. **Business understanding:** An important question is if do we need ML for the project. The goal of the project has to be measurable. 
2. **Data understanding:** Analyze available data sources, and decide if more data is required. 
3. **Data preparation:** Clean data and remove noise applying pipelines, and the data should be converted to a tabular format, so we can put it into ML.
4. **Modeling:** training Different models and choose the best one. Considering the results of this step, it is proper to decide if is required to add new features or fix data issues. 
5. **Evaluation:** Measure how well the model is performing and if it solves the business problem. 
6. **Deployment:** Roll out to production to all the users. The evaluation and deployment often happen together - **online evaluation**. 

It is important to consider how well maintainable the project is.
  
In general, ML projects require many iterations.

**Iteration:** 
* Start simple
* Learn from the feedback
* Improve


## 1.5 Model Selection Process
### Which model to choose?
- Logistic regression
- Decision tree
- Neural Network
- Or many others

The validation dataset is not used in training. There are feature matrices and y vectors
for both training and validation datasets. 
The model is fitted with training data, and it is used to predict the y values of the validation
feature matrix. Then, the predicted y values (probabilities)
are compared with the actual y values. 

**Multiple comparisons problem (MCP):** just by chance one model can be lucky and obtain
good predictions because all of them are probabilistic. 

The test set can help to avoid the MCP. Obtaining the best model is done with the training and validation datasets, while the test dataset is used for assuring that the proposed best model is the best. 

1. Split datasets in **training**, **validation**, and **test**. E.g. 60%, 20% and 20% respectively 
2. Train the models
3. Evaluate the models
4. Select the best model 
5. Apply the best model to the test dataset 
6. Compare the performance metrics of validation and test

## 1.7 Introduction to NumPy
Numpy, short for Numerical Python, is a powerful Python library that enables efficient and convenient array manipulation and mathematical operations. It forms the foundation for many scientific and data-related tasks. In this article, we'll provide a straightforward explanation of Numpy concepts and how to use them.

## Importing Numpy

Before diving into Numpy's capabilities, we need to import it. Conventionally, we import Numpy with the alias `np`, making it easier to reference its functions:

```python
import numpy as np
```

## Creating Arrays

Arrays are the building blocks of Numpy, and they can be thought of as lists but with enhanced features.

### Creating Arrays with Zeros, Ones, or Constants

You can create arrays filled with zeros, ones, or any constant using `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, and `np.full()`:

```python
zeros_array = np.zeros(10)
ones_array = np.ones(10)
constant_array = np.full(10, 3)
```

### Converting Lists to Arrays

To convert a Python list into a Numpy array, you can use `np.array()`:

```python
my_list = [2, 3, 4]
array_from_list = np.array(my_list)
```

### Generating Ranges of Numbers

Numpy provides functions for generating arrays of sequential numbers. For example:

```python
range_array = np.arange(10)  # Creates an array from 0 to 9
```

### Creating Arrays with Linear Spacing

`np.linspace()` creates arrays with evenly spaced numbers within a specified range:

```python
linspace_array = np.linspace(0, 1, 11)  # Creates 11 numbers from 0 to 1
```

### Multi-dimensional Arrays

Numpy can handle multi-dimensional arrays, often referred to as matrices. Here are some examples:

```python
zeros_matrix = np.zeros((5, 2))
ones_matrix = np.ones((5, 2))
constant_matrix = np.full((5, 2), 3)
```

## Indexing and Slicing Arrays

Like Python lists, you can access elements in Numpy arrays using indexing and slicing. For two-dimensional arrays:

```python
arr = np.array([[2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6]])
first_row = arr[0]      # Gets the first row
first_col = arr[:, 0]  # Gets the first column
```

## Generating Random Arrays

Numpy can create arrays filled with random numbers. To ensure reproducibility, you can set a seed using `np.random.seed()`:

```python
np.random.seed(2)  # Set the seed
random_array = np.random.rand(5, 2)  # Generates random numbers between 0 and 1
```

For random numbers from a normal distribution or integers within a range:

```python
normal_distribution = np.random.randn(5, 2)
random_integers = np.random.randint(low=0, high=100, size=(5, 2))
```

## Array Operations

Numpy excels in performing mathematical operations on arrays efficiently.

### Element-wise Operations

You can perform operations on entire arrays element by element:

```python
arr = arr + 1   # Adds 1 to each element
arr = arr * 2   # Multiplies each element by 2
# Similar operations for division and exponentiation
```

### Element-wise Operations with Two Arrays

You can also perform operations between two arrays of the same shape:

```python
arr1 = np.ones(4)
arr2 = np.full(4, 3)
result = arr1 + arr2  # Element-wise addition
result = arr1 / arr2  # Element-wise division
```

### Comparison Operations

You can perform element-wise comparisons and create boolean arrays:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
greater_than_2 = arr > 2  # Produces [False, False, True, True]
```

### Selecting Elements Based on Conditions

You can create subarrays based on certain conditions:

```python
selected_elements = arr[arr > 1]  # Gets elements greater than 1
```

## Summary Operations

Numpy provides functions for summarizing array data:

```python
min_value = arr.min()    # Minimum value
max_value = arr.max()    # Maximum value
sum_value = arr.sum()    # Sum of all elements
mean_value = arr.mean()  # Mean (average) value
std_deviation = arr.std()  # Standard deviation
```

In conclusion, Numpy is an essential library for anyone working with numerical data in Python. It simplifies array creation, manipulation, and mathematical operations, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing and data analysis. With the basics covered in this article, you're well on your way to harnessing Numpy's capabilities.

##  1.9 Introduction to Pandas

### DataFrame. 
It is a two-dimensional table-like structure that allows you to store and manipulate data in a row-column format. You can think of it as a spreadsheet or a SQL table. The DataFrame is designed to handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

### Series 
one-dimensional labeled array. It is similar to a column in a DataFrame and can be used to store and manipulate a single variable. Series are particularly useful when you need to perform operations on a specific column or extract a subset of data from a DataFrame.

### Index 
The numbers in the first column refer to each row (called Index).

### Element-wise operations
When looking at data, NaN values can occur. NaN means “not a number”. The following example illustrates this.
